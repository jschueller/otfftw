\subsection{FFTW}


\begin{description}
\item[Usage :]  \strut
  \begin{description}
  \item $FFTW()$
  \end{description}
\item[Arguments :] None
\item[Value :]  a FFTW instance, it means an algorithm able to perform discrete Fourier transforms using the fftw library.
\item[Some methods :]  \strut

  \begin{description}

  \item $transform$
    \begin{description}
    \item[Usage :]  $transform(collection)$
    \item[Usage :]  $transform(collection, first, size)$
    \item[Arguments :]  \strut
      \begin{description}
      \item $collection$ : a NumericalComplexCollection of length $n$.
      \item $first$ : an integer, the index of the first element of $collection$ to be taken into account. We must have $first < n$.
      \item $size$ : an integer, the size of the sub-sequence of $collection$ to be transformed. We must have $first+size \leq n$.
      \end{description}
    \item[Value :] a NumericalComplexCollection, containing the direct discrete Fourier transform of the whole collection for the first usage and of the sub-sequence starting at position $first$ and of length $size$ for the second usage.
    \end{description}

  \item $inverseTransform$
    \begin{description}
    \item[Usage :]  $inverseTransform(collection)$
    \item[Usage :]  $inverseTransform(collection, first, size)$
    \item[Arguments :]  \strut
      \begin{description}
      \item $collection$ : a NumericalComplexCollection of length $n$.
      \item $first$ : an integer, the index of the first element of $collection$ to be taken into account. We must have $first < n$.
      \item $size$ : an integer, the size of the sub-sequence of $collection$ to be transformed. We must have $first+size \leq n$.
      \end{description}
    \item[Value :] a NumericalComplexCollection, containing the inverse discrete Fourier transform of the whole collection for the first usage and of the sub-sequence starting at position $first$ and of length $size$ for the second usage.
